1.0.0 - 2013-07-31 - Lew Ayotte
	Initial Release
1.0.2 - 2013-09-20 - Packaging Bot
	Updated lib/updater to version 1.0.3
1.0.3 - 2013-10-02 - Packaging Bot (lib/updater)
	Big rewrite to the updater in order to make the code more flexible. This improves compatibility with plugins that allow for remote updating of plugins and themes.
	The updater now supports providing changelog details for plugins and themes that have updates available. These details can be viewed by clicking the "View version **** details" link for the appropriate plugin or theme.
1.0.4 - 2013-10-04 - Packaging Bot (lib/updater)
	Enhancement: When releases with four version digits are released (such as 2.1.0.3), by default, the updater will not offer to update if just this last digit is updated. For instance, it will not automatically offer to update 2.1.0.1 to 2.1.0.3; rather, an automatic upgrade will become available when version 2.1.1 or greater is released. If you wish to force an update to these versions, you can add ithemes-updater-force-minor-update=1 to an admin page request (such as http://domain.com/wp-admin/index.php?ithemes-updater-force-minor-update=1) in order to force the updater make these releases available for an hour. If the update is not performed within the hour, the updater reverts back to default behavior.
	Bug Fix: Corrected source of the following error when updating: Download failed. SSL certificate problem, verify that the CA cert is OK. Details: error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed
	Bug Fix: Corrected source of the following warning: Warning: require_once(/api.php) [function.require-once]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory
1.0.5 - 2013-10-07 - Packaging Bot (lib/updater)

1.0.8 - 2013-10-23 - Lew Ayotte
    Fixed version number for updater script
1.0.9 - 2013-10-28 - Packaging Bot (lib/updater)
	Enhancement: Added a "Quick Release Updates" setting to the bottom of the licensing page. Enabling this option allows the site to receive automatic update notices for product quick releases (releases that do not have automatic update support by default).
	Enhancement: Changed how the licensing page works on Multisite. Now it will appear at Settings > iThemes Licensing in the network admin Dashboard and at Settings > iThemes Licensing on sites when the current user is a network admin. This prevents exposing the licensing page to users that don't are not super users and thus should not be performing updates. As this update makes the functionality of the "Licensing Page Access" setting obsolete, the setting has been removed.
	Enhancement: Using the ithemes-updater-force-minor-update query string variable will now force a data flush, allowing any available quick release updates to appear instantly.
	Enhancement: Added "License" links to the Plugins and Themes pages for the Network Admin Dashboard of multisite installs.
